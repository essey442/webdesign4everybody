            <img class="right" src="https://www.traveller.com.au/content/dam/images/h/1/e/d/0/o/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.h1e4gx.png/1557793947729.jpg" alt="Wynwood Walls Street Art">
            <p class="left">Wynwood is home to the highest concentration of street art in the country. 
                Muralists from around the world showcase their talent on walls with 
                larger-than-life masterpieces. This open-air street art installation - 
                one of the largest in the world - is one of the reasons a formerly 
                run-down neighborhood found new life as the art hub of Miami. Just 
                minutes from Downtown Miami, near Midtown and the Miami Design District, 
                this thriving neighborhood centers around Wynwood Walls. A collection of 
                giant wall murals covering six buildings, Wynwood Walls has since become 
                a blank canvas for famed artists from across the globe. </p>

            <p class="left">Little Havana is Miami's vibrant Cuban heart, with Latin American 
                art galleries and busy restaurants. Cafes with walk-up windows sell Cuban 
                coffee to cigar-smoking patrons. On Calle Ocho (SW 8th Street), locals discuss 
                politics over dominoes at Maximo Gomez Park, dubbed Domino Park by locals. The 
                historic Tower Theater screens independent and revival films, while the area's 
                clubs host live Latin music. This area is a little slice of Cuba that's kept alive in the United States: 
                one of the liveliest neighbourhoods in all Miami. Little Havana began life 
                with the of the Cuban dissidents who had fled Castro's regime and begun a 
                new life in the USA, maintaining many elements of their native culture. The 
                population of Little Havana is a little over 50,000, and of these 98% are

                from the regime of Fidel Castro. A National Historic Landmark, Freedom Tower 
                illustrates the important story of the Cuban exodus to the United States and 
                resettlement during the Cold War. Because of the political climate of the era, 
                Cubans seeking political asylum received a warm welcome into the United States. 
                Many Cubans fled to Miami, Florida because of its close proximity to Cuba.</p>

                And there is a good reason for it - the wildlife is incredible, you can't just take a 
                boat tour to view crocodiles and dolphins anywhere or go hiking with the chance to see 
                turtles and alligators along the way. Everglades National Park protects an unparalleled 
                landscape that provides important 
                habitat for numerous rare and endangered species like the manatee, American crocodile, 
                and the elusive Florida panther. Everglades National Park is a 1.5-million-acre wetlands 
                preserve on the southern tip of the U.S. state of Florida. Often compared to a grassy, 
                slow-moving river, the Everglades is made up of coastal mangroves, sawgrass marshes and 
                pine flatwoods that are home to hundreds of animal species.</p>

                Beach, about a quarter mile west of the Atlantic Ocean. Ocean Drive continues north to 15th Street, immediately
